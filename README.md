# Search-Engine
Implementing a search engine that answers queries on Wikipedia articles.
Our corpus (document collection) is Wikipedia articles. 
To simplify our work and focus on the core algorithms, we wonâ€™t write the crawler to get the articles from Wikipedia. 
We will use a prebuilt file which contains approximately 50,000 articles

Link to that prebuilt file: []()

The way we are going to build this is in 3 parts:

- Create Index: Building the index of our search engine.
- Query Index: Answering search queries on the index that we built.
- Ranking: Ranking the search results of query index.
